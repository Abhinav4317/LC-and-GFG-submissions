            Approach
Recursive Structure: We know that each string is formed from the previous one. For any string Sn, it has a clear midpoint (at index 2^(n-1)). The second half of the string is the inverted and reversed version of the first half.

Base Case: When n = 1, the string is "0", so the first bit is always "0".

Recursion:

If k is the middle bit, return '1' since thatâ€™s how the binary string is defined.
If k is in the first half of the string, it directly corresponds to a position in the previous string Sn-1.
If k is in the second half, find its corresponding position in the first half of Sn-1, then invert the result.
This approach avoids generating the string explicitly, instead using recursive calls to efficiently determine the k-th bit.
